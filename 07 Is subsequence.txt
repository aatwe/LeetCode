What given?s and t
What inside s and t?
		s //short string: hofsijdfosij	//lower case english letter		// <=100
		t //long string: aljfdlksajdflkasdflklkn	//lowercase english letter	// ~ 5 lac


What is subsequence?
	letters removed from string 
		//position of character should not be disturbed

for ex t = abcde
subsequence s = ace	
not subseq : aec

What if s =0 -> is a subsequence

0) corner case: if s = 0
	if(s.length() == 0) return true;
1)  Create 2 pointers for s and t and initilaize to 0
	int s_pointer = 0;
	int t_pointer = 0;	


2) loop thorugh t looking for all characters from s
	loop how long? till pointer reaches end of string t

	
while(t_pointer < t.length()) {
	if(t.charAt(t_pointer) == s.charAt(s_pointer)) {	//Check if first char of s is in t
		s_pointer++;				//if yes increment s_pointer to next in s
	if(s_pointer == s.length()) return true;		//keep incrementing till reach end of s string, if we reach end of string means all characters from s scanned and present in t
}
t_pointer++;					//if first char of s is not in t increment t and check for next char in t and compare with s
}
